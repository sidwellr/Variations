In Apophysis 7X15C and later, linear is actually linear3D. In JWildfire, linear is the same as linear3D when Preserve Z is set.

## linear3D
Copy the input (x, y, and z).

Type: 3D

Chaotica is only 2D, but supports linear3D for compatibility.

See links under linear above.

## linearT
Tweak of linear, adding an exponent for x and y.

Type: 2D

Parameter values between 0 and 2 make the most sense. Same as linear when both are 1.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| powX | Exponent for x |
| powY | Exponent for y |

## linearT3D
Tweak of linear3D, adding an exponent for x, y, and z.

Type: 3D

Parameter values between 0 and 2 make the most sense. Same as linear3D when all are 1.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| powX | Exponent for x |
| powY | Exponent for y |
| powZ | Exponent for z |
