# Complex Functions
Variations that perform standard math functions using complex numbers. Most of the math functions don't need extra parameters. Some have been extended with parameters that don't have any particular mathematical significance, but can have interesting effects; just experiment with changing them. The default values make these variations work the same as the original variations.
