| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| position | Position of the checkerboard along its perpendicular axis |

| axis | 0: Checkerboard on XY plane<br>1: Checkerboard on YZ plane<br>2: Checkerboard on ZX plane |
| checker_size | Size of each square (as a fraction of size) |
| displ_amount | Thickness of the checkerboard |
| checker_color1, checker_color2 | Gradient index of the squares (between 0 and 1) |
| side_color | Gradient index of the square borders (if present) |
| with_sides | 0: No borders on the squares<br>1: Add borders to the squares (displ_amount must be non-zero) |

## dc_perlin

Type: 2D direct color blur  
Author: Neil Slater (slobo777)  
Date: 14 Nov 2010  

[![](dc_perlin-1.png)](dc_perlin-1.flame)

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| shape | The shape to use:<br>0: Square<br>1: Disk (filled-in circle)<br>2: Blur disk (brighter in center, like the blur variation) |
| map | Mapping from the noise function to the shape:<br>0: Flat<br>1: Spherical (like the spherical variation, creates small features in the center)<br>2: Half-spherical (like spherical, but with less distortion)<br>3: Quarter-spherical (between 1 and 2)<br>4: Bubble (like the bubble variation; the result is still 2D, but has a 3D appearance)<br>5: Exaggerated bubble (like bubble but the effect is stronger) |
| select_centre, select_range | Noise values outside the range of select_centreÂ±select_range create holes (transparent areas) in the pattern; increase select_range to eliminate unwanted holes |
| centre | The center gradient index value to use, between 0 and 1; works with range to determine the gradient color to use |
| range | The range of gradient values on each side of centre to use; 0.5 to use the entire gradient; larger values will use the gradient multiple times |
| edge | 0 for normal; positive values increase the size and create a ragged edge |
| scale | Scale factor for the noise function; increase for higher frequency noise (smaller features that are closer together) |
| octaves | Number of octaves to use for fBm, between 1 and 5 |
| amps | Value to divide the amplitude of each octave by; use 2 for normal fBm noise, but change for different effects (normally greater than 1, but this is not enforced) |
| freqs | Value to multiply the frequency of each octave by; use 2 for normal fBm noise, but change for different effects (normally greater than 1, but this is not enforced) |
| z | The z value for computing the noise; changing it changes the specific pattern but not the general appearance of the noise |
| select_bailout | Limits the number of retries when the random point hits a hole controlled by the select_centre, select_range, and edge parameters; the default of 10 is usually fine, but it can be increased if faint patterns show in the holes (this will slow down the variation) |

## wangtiles
Generate a (possibly repeating) pattern from a 12x8 set of Wang tiles.

Type: 3D blur  
Author: Jesus Sosa  
Tile artist: Guy Walker  
Date: 29 Apr 2018  

[![](wangtiles-1.png)](wangtiles-1.flame) [![](wangtiles-2.png)](wangtiles-2.flame)

The core Wang tiling is always 12 wide and 8 high, so the tiles are elongated vertically. This is why the vertical pipes in the first example are thinner than the horizontal pipes. To use square tiles, set scale_x to 1.5 (and optionally square to 0 and offset_x to -0.25).

The wangtiles variation will also set z based on the color of the point, like [colorscale_wf](zmanip/zmanip.md#colorscale_wf). This is not a bump map for the tile, so it won't make the result an accurate 3D tiling.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| id | The id of the Wang tile set to use, from 0 to 104 ([pdf index](wangtiles-ids.pdf)) |
| seed | The random seed; changes the pattern of the tiles |
| square | 0: Make the overall wangtiles shape a rectangle<br>1: Make the overall wangtiles shape a square |
| scale_x, scale_y | Horizontal and vertical scale factors for the Wang tiles |
| scale_z | Scale factor for z colorscale setting; 0 to disable |
| offset_x, offset_y | Horizontal and vertical offsets for the Wang tiles |
| offset_z | Offset added to the z value of each point |
| tile_x | 0: Don't tile horizontally (space outside the 12x8 Wang tile set will be black)<br>1: Tile the Wang tile set horizontally |
| tile_y | 0: Don't tile vertically (space outside the 12x8 Wang tile set will be black)<br>1: Tile the Wang tile set vertically |
| reset_z | 0: Add the color index to existing z value<br>1: Override existing z value with the color index |
