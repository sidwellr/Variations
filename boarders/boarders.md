## tri_boarders2
Hexagon version of boarders. Source not found.

Type: 2D  
Author: Alexey Ermushev (eralex61)  
Date: Early 2008

Comment in xtrb source code:
"Some comments on TriBorders plugin structure. It builds dual tessellation
on triangle grid as Boarders variation does for square one and it uses
trilinear coordinates instead of usual Cartesian system (from where Tri Borders in plugin name)."

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| radius |   |
| width |   |

## xtrb
Modification of tri_boarders2 with extra parameters.

Type: 2D  
Author: Georg Kiehne (xyrus02)  
Date: 17 Nov 2012

![](xtrb-1.png)

To imitate tri_boarders2, set power, dist, a, and b to 1 and the amount to the square root of the tri_boarders2 amount.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| power |   |
| radius |   |
| width |   |
| dist |   |
| a |   |
| b |   |

Bug: The amount is multiplied twice, which may cause unexpected results. To work around, set the amount to the square root of what would normally be used.
