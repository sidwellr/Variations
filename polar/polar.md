There are also post_ and pre_ versions (post_polar2 and pre_polar2).

## pre_polar2_y
Flawed attempt at a pre version of polar2.

Type: 2D  
Author: Kenny Vaneetvelde (Raykoid666)  
Date: 17 Oct 2008  

Included here for completeness only; there are several flaws in the implementation.

## unpolar
Treat the rectangular coordinates (x,y) of a point as log-polar coordinates (ρ,θ) (the inverse of polar2).

Note: The variation inexplicably scales the result down by 2π. The author undoubtedly had a reason for doing this, but it generally makes the result too small. So a tip for using unpolar: as a starting point, change the amount from 1 to 6.28 (a rough approximation of 2π).
