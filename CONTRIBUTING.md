# Contributing

I am not actively seeking contributors to this project. But if you want to help, know MarkDown and how to use git, and don't mind assigning your copyright to me, go ahead and make a pull request. I'll probably accept it. And I'll make a spot to list contributors.

If you do choose to contribute, try to keep the style similar to what's already here. Since I'm not expecting contributions, I'm not writing a style guide.
