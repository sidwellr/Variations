# Flame Fractal Variation Information
This is an attempt to list summary information and resources about the many variations used in programs like Apophysis and JWildfire. Right now, it is more an experiment. With a thousand variations to cover, it will take awhile to get them all!

Most variations are grouped with similar ones, so scroll up or down when you get to a variation summary to see them. There are two ways to browse the information:

* By variation name. Start at [Variations](Variations.md), which lists the variations in alphabetical order with a one line description of each. Click on the variation you want information on.

* By group. Start at [Groups](Groups.md), which list the grouping of variations with images representing the variations in each group. Click on the group name to see the group or on an image to go to the specific variation it exemplifies.

If you find errors, feel free to create an issue by scrolling to the top of any page and clicking "Issues". But please don't create issues for missing variations; I'm already aware most variations are missing.
