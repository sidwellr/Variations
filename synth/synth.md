# Synth
Variations that emulate a number of other variations, adding wavy effects using a technique from audio synthesizers.

## synth v1
The first version of synth is still available, but superceded by synth V2. It doesn't have as many options, but otherwise works the same as the later version, so see its description below for details.

Synth is complicated because it has so many parameters. Understanding the basic structure of the variation is helpful. Synth is divided into a main module and five waveform modules, named 'b' through 'f'. The main module takes the input point and transforms it like a typical variation; the mode parameter determines how it works. The waveform modules each generate a waveform based on the input point and the mode and apply it to the output of the previous module (module b uses parameter a as the input); mode determines the direction (radial, horizontal, etc.). The outputs of the main module and the final waveform module are then combined to produce the final output.

### Main module
The main module applies a variation to the input point; some match other variations, some are unique to synth. Parameter mode specifies the variation to use; the others modify it.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| a | The baseline for the waveform (normally 1) |
| mode | Selects the variation to use, the wave direction, and how the waveform is applied (see next table) |
| power | For modes that use the distance of the point from the origin (the "radius"), power controls how this is done (it isn't the power itself, but used to calculate it). For other modes, it is a parameter for the variation. For the rest, it is ignored.
| mix | How much of the final waveform to mix in; 1 is normal, 0 ignores the waveforms, values between 0 and 1 interpolate, values outside that range extrapolate |
| smooth | For some modes, 0 uses normal linear mapping and 1 uses quadratic Bezier mapping that makes it less aggressive near the origin or away from the unit circle, smoothing the effect. For some modes, 0 selects multiply and 1 selects mixing to apply the waveform. For some modes, smooth is ignored (linear mapping is always used).

The following table describes the modes.

| Example | Mode, Direction, Application, and Description |
| --- | --- |
| [![](synth-0.png)](synth-0.flame) | 0: spherical, radial, multiply<br>Reflects the plane across the unit circle, like the spherical variation.<br>Power adjusts the radius calculation; -2 to match the spherical variation, 0 to act like linear.<br>Smooth selects between linear (0) and Bezier (1) mapping.

### Waveform modules (modules b, c, d, e, and f)
The five waveform modules are invoked in sequence, and, if enabled, apply a waveform. The parameters for each are the same.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| b, c, d, e, f | Amplitude of the waveform for the given module; 0 to disable the module |
| x_type | Shape of the wave<br>0: sine<br>1: cosine<br>2: square<br>3: sawtooth<br>4: triangle<br>5: concave<br>6: convex<br>7: ngon (x_freq is the number of sides)<br>8: inverse ngon |
| x_freq | Frequency of the wave (1 repeats once around the circle if radial, or once per unit otherwise); fractional values are allowed, but create a discontinuity |
| x_skew | Skew effect, between -1 and 1; 0 for normal, -1 for just the left half, 1 for just the right half |
| x_phs | Phase of the wave in radians; 0 for normal |
| x_layer | How this waveform combines with the input:<br>0: add<br>1: multiply<br>2: maximum<br>3: minimum |
