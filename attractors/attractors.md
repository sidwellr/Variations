# Attractors
These variations use the formulas for strange attractors. They are mostly normal variations, not blurs, and will produce the actual attractor when used on a single transform by themselves with no affine transforms, as is done with all of the examples shown here. But their use is, of course, not restricted to this. The parameters mostly define the attractor and have no specific meaning.

## lorenz_js
Strange attractor first studied by Edward Lorenz.

Type: 3D Direct Color  
Author: Jesus Sosa  
Date: 12 Dec 2017  

[![](lorenz-1.png)](lorenz-1.flame)

Lorenz uses Euler's method to solve the Lorenz system of ordinary differential equations. Coloring is based on the resulting x and y values.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| a - c | Variables that define the attractor; a is sometimes known as the Prandtl number and b the Rayleigh number |
| h | Step size for the Euler approximation |
| centerx, centery | Offset for direct coloring |
| scale | Scale for direct coloring |
